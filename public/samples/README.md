# Audio Samples

Place your MP3 files in this directory with the following names:

- **top.mp3** - Sample that plays for the first note of each cycle (accent)
- **chug.mp3** - Sample that plays for all other notes in the cycle
- **stack.mp3** - Sample that plays for the metronome quarter note clicks
- **snare.mp3** - Sample that plays on beat 3 of every measure

## File Requirements

- Format: MP3
- Make sure the files are not too long if you want tight rhythmic patterns
- The app will trigger these samples at the appropriate times based on your rhythmic groupings

## How it works

1. **top.mp3** plays at the beginning of each rhythmic cycle
2. **chug.mp3** plays for every other note in the cycle
3. **stack.mp3** plays steady quarter notes as a metronome
4. **snare.mp3** plays on beat 3 of each measure (assuming 4/4 time)

The samples will be triggered automatically when you hit the "Play" button after selecting a grouping.
